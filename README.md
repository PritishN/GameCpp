# Random Maze Generator Game 
A game making project in C++ which was used as our 3rd semester project work.
This is an attempt at implementing the basics of Ray Casting to make a 3D looking game.
The game generates a random maze for the user to explore. The world is rendered using an external library named SFML Library.

### Dependencies:
 SFML Library, G++ compiler

### Installation Instructions:
 Debian:
    
    sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
  
### For compiling and building the game executable
    
    g++ main.o -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system

### Running the game
    ./sfml-app
